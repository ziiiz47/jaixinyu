## Tech Stack

- **Three.js** — 3D scene and particle rendering
- **MediaPipe Hands** — Gesture detection and tracking
- **Web Audio API** — Microphone volume collection and "blowing" determination
- **Tailwind CSS** — Rapid page styling
- **Google Fonts** and other frontend resources

---

## Environment Requirements

- Modern browser (Recommended: Latest version of Chrome / Edge / Firefox)
- For gesture or candle blowing interactions:
  - **Camera** permission required (gesture recognition)
  - **Microphone** permission required (breath detection, or use key/long press instead)

> ⚠️ Note:
> Directly opening `index.html` with `file://` for local deployment will trigger browser security policies, causing camera/microphone unavailability.
> Please access through HTTP/HTTPS local server.

## Quick Start

### Method 1: VS Code + Live Server (Recommended)

1. Open the project root directory (containing `index.html`) with VS Code.
2. Install and enable the VS Code plugin **"Live Server"**.
3. Right-click on `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
4. Browser will automatically open `http://127.0.0.1:xxxx/index.html` (port varies).

### Method 2: Any Static Server (using http-server as example)

Make sure Node.js and npm are installed, then run after entering the project root directory:

```bash
# If http-server is not yet installed
npm install -g http-server

# Start local static server (sample port 5500)
http-server -c-1 . -p 5500
# Then visit in browser
# http://localhost:5500/index.html
```

## Others:
- Deployment displays the `index.html` file in the root directory. Please modify to the actual filename as needed.
- There is also an `index_c.html` file in the root directory, which is another style page. There are some issues, such as the cake effect not being well presented. Can be modified by yourself if time permits.
- This project has poor compatibility with mobile devices. Android devices do not work well with built-in mobile browsers, and microphone and camera permissions are likely to be unavailable. Apple devices can be used normally. However, there is a common issue that the birthday song plays through the earpiece. For reconstruction recommendations, using a framework refactor may help avoid the above issues.
